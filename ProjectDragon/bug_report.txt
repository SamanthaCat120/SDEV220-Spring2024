The biggest issue with this project is realizing that what I imagined was much bigger than what we covered this 8-weeks. Additionally, on week 4, I went to help my parents, intended on working on homework that Sunday, but was delayed. From there on, I was behind, trying to catch up on homework. I discovered it is pretty much impossible to try to intake new information while simultaneously trying to covertly work on assignments. This was much easier to do in high school band class, though it still wasn't entirely successful to go unnoticed. [sidenote: it was amusing when a percussion player was asked by his English teacher if he studied English in band class. Everybody in the band assured her he did.] 
I thought about changing it to be somewhat like an Oregan Trail-type UX. I intend on exploring more as I gain more knowledge.
