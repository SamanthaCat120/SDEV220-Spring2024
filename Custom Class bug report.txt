Custom Class bug report

when adding example usage, Spyder indicated it expected that block to be indented. Realized forgot to type "pass" to "else"

when attempting to define new instance, Spyder indicated "could not assign function call". Realized parenthesis weren't properly around the entire line.

Then, also realized the play method was inside of the init method. Corrected indentions

Added uml file, but I see it's raw data, so I'm adding a png version.
