I was over-zealous. First, I wanted to try to create a replication where the ID was the same as Amazon's ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number). I also watched both videos, but I like the FastAPI better because it was done on a Windows machine and used sublime text. When I first put in an ASIN by looking the books up on the site, I realized that unless I had the physical book in my hands (and lately, most of the things I've read are Kindle or audio), I'd never memorize the ASIN to pull up the id, so I changed back to inputting simple integers1, 2, etc.
